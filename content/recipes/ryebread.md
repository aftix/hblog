# Whole Wheat Rye Bread Experiment

## Ingredients

  * 2 teaspoons instant yeast
  * 200 g whole wheat flour
  * 30 g bread flour
  * 150 g dark rye flour
  * 1.5 teaspoons table salt
  * 1 tablespoon sugar
  * 3 tablespoons of sesame seed
  * 80 g old-fashioned rolled oats
  * 60 g butter, melted
  * 300 g warm water

## Directions

  1. Combine instant yeast, whole wheat flower, bread flour, dark rye flour,
    salt, sugar, sesame seeds, and rolled oats in a large bowl. Whisk together.
  2. Whisk in melted butter
  3. Stir in warm water with the handle end of a wooden spoon
    (so the dough doesn't clump on the spoon end).
  4. Once you can't mix anymore, flour your hands and knead the dough right there in
  the bowl until smooth and supple, about 10 minutes.
  5. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let the dough rise until doubled in size,
  about 1.5 to 2 hours.
  6. Punch the dough down and flip over in the bowl. Sprinkle the top with rolled oats
  and and gently press them into the top. Loosely cover again until doubled in size, 1
  to 1.25 hours.
  7. Heat your oven to 375°F with the dutch oven inside. Once hot, gently lay your
  dough ball inside. Cut two cuts into the top of the ball with a knife and sprinkle
  more sesame seeds on top. Throw around two handfuls of water into the dutch oven
  put on the lid to keep the steam in. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until the temperature
  is 190°F inside.
  8. Let cool completely on a rack before cutting in (with a serrated knife).

## Equipment

## Notes

This recipe yields a fairly dense loaf. I am still testing ways to make it fluffier.
The flavor is great. I'd take a photo but my phone camera is fuzzy.
