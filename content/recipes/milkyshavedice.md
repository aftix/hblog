# Milky Shaved Ice

![Milky Shaved Ice in a bowl](/imgs/recipes/milkyshavedice.jpg)

Shaved ice, but slightly sweet and very milky. Eat as is, top with fruit,
make it into bingsu!

## Ingredients

  * 2 tbsp sweetened condensed milk
  * 1.25 cups (300 mL) milk (I used almond milk, use your favorite dairy or nut milk)

*NOTE* This is a 1:10 ratio of sweetened condensed milk:milk by volume that makes a good size
for my machine

## Directions

  1. Mix sweetened condensed milk and milk together in a freezer safe cylindrical container
     (I use a freezer safe deli soup container) 
  2. Place into freezer and let freeze into a solid puck (I wait around 24 hours)
  3. Place puck into shaved ice machine and turn into shaved ice!
