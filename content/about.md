## About

I'm a DevOps engineer. I have a degree in Computer Science and Physics, with minors in Mathematics
and Technical Writing. I'm very interested in programming, plasma physics, fluid simulation, game
engines, game physics, urban design, biking, and public transit.

## School

I went to Angelo State University for my undergraduate degree. I attended UT Austin for two years
(four semesters) in a Ph.D. program, from which I am currently on leave of absence.
