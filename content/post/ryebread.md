# Whole Wheat Rye Bread

I really like making bread, even though I'm not really
supposed to be eating bread in my diet. Nevertheless, I persist
in eating and making bread. This is a recipe I'm currently working on
that came out with good results for a whole wheat rye bread.

## Equipment
* A large bowl
* A wooden spoon
* A dutch oven
* A cooling rack
* Possibly a whisk
* Possibly a thermometer

## Ingredients
* 2 teaspoons instant yeast
* 200 g whole wheat flour
* 30 g bread flour
* 150 g dark rye flour
* 1.5 teaspoons table salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 3 tablespoons of sesame seed
* 80 g old-fashioned rolled oats
* 60 g butter, melted
* 300 g warm water

## Instructions
1. Combine everything except the butter and water in a large bowl. Whisk together.
2. Add the melted butter and whisk in
3. Add the warm water and stir in with the handle end of a wooden spoon
  (so the dough doesn't clump on the spoon end).
4. Once you can't mix anymore, flour your hands and knead the dough right there in
the bowl until smooth and supple, about 10 minutes.
5. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled in size,
about 1.5 to 2 hours.
6. Punch the dough down and flip over in the bowl. Sprinkle the top with rolled oats
and and gently press them into the top. Loosely cover again until doubled in size, 1
to 1.25 hours.
7. Preheat your oven to 375°F with the dutch oven inside. Once hot, gently lay your
dough ball inside. Cut two cuts into the top of the ball with a knife and sprinkle
more sesame seeds on top. Throw around two handfuls of water into the dutch oven
put on the lid to keep the steam in. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until the temperature
is 190°F inside.
8. Let cool completely on a rack before cutting in.

## Notes
This recipe yields a fairly dense loaf. I am still testing ways to make it fluffier.
The flavor is great. I'd take a photo but my phone camera is fuzzy.
